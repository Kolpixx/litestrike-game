Here are instructions to get a litestrike server up and running manualy
mainly for linux, can be adapted for windows

pre setup:
java 21 is installed
litestrike is compiled


make a new directory and enter it

download paper: https://papermc.io/downloads/paper
move paper jar to the directory

run paper jar
$ java -jar <paper_server_jar_name>
	- you can add the -nogui option to the end of the command to prevent the gui

accept the paper eula

start server again and stop it when done starting

remove all the directorys starting with "world"

open server.properties
	set allow-nether=false
	set online-mode=false
	DONT CHANGE DEFUALT WORLD NAME
	TODO how to set resource pack
	you can set spawn-monsters=false
	maybe set enforce-secure-profile=false

open bukkit.yml
	set allow-end: false

TODO setup offline mode for proxy use

move the directory containing the litestrike map into the server directory
	-make sure the map is called "world"
	-make sure it contains a valid map_config.json file

go into plugin folder
	-download latest version of protocolib and move it here
	-move compiled litestrike jar into here

go back to server directory

start the server, it should now be ready!

might have to set yourself to op
